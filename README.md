# GAN Studio

A web application for training and testing GANs (generative adversarial networks), which was
the technique for image-based generative AI before diffusion took over.


I developed this in high school (2018) for my software development major project.


Many poor decisions were made.

For example, the entire thing (neural networks + UI) was programmed from scratch using vanilla JavaScript.
